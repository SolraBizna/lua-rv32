This program uses `lua-rv32` to emulate a simple machine designed only to run programs in the Embench™ benchmark suite. It requires some minor changes to the Embench tree in order to run. (These changes are, unfortunately, currently left as an exercise for the user.)

Like `lua-rv32`, this program uses `demac` to embody versions for both Lua 5.2 and 5.3+. This facilitates benchmarking of both versions of the emulator.
